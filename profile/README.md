#  üëã Howdy~! Good Display is finally here on Github. Nice to meet you all~!
This happened with an interesting episode~!
Some of you might remember that we do own a github account that published repositories, https://github.com/abao66669999 . 
Many may type slowly a big ? when they for the 1st time seeing it because oh man, what is abao66669999? It's too ÊäΩË±° (abstract in Chinese) and seems far-fetched.
You've gotta take this GITHUB thing more seriously.
And, it's not yet an organization account with it's EPD example libraries out-dated with no one instilling with blood, time, energy to take good care of it...

So, after taking Martin Fasani's good advice, (https://github.com/martinberlin) to open one here to keep up with MODERNIZATION just like many other good companies are doing right the moment!!! Hoorray! Finally!

Our MAIN Work here- Create and maintain the NEW library for E-paper displays from Good Display
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br/>
We wish to extend our service from our own server now to GITHUB

<br/>


1. We are no longer tied to only with email, web-online message thing<br/>
2. We march in good platforms like Github, we adopt good advice with multiple forms to interact and to better provide with servic<br/>
3. We will keep up with the good work while we will innovate and we want to get you on board<br/>
4. We are maker-friendly and wish to create an excellent ECOSYSTEM for developers, makers and those whoever would like to get their hands on E-paper<br/>


# [Our comprehensive development kits](https://www.good-display.com/product/53/) 
All the boards for STM32/ArduinoUNO/ESP32/ESP8266 have undergone an upgradation with the example codes changed a little bit.
So for any of our loyal supportors both old and new, if you happen to buy one very new board from us (2022 the latter half),
you will then need to use the newest example code for each EPD model.
<br/>

# [For now you might also go here to download the example](https://www.good-display.com/blank15.html) 


BUT We will make sure we update them here ASAP. And the very aim we setting up Good Display's community here also allows every one to join the discussion.
